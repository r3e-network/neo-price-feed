   - **Alternative**: NeoLine browser extension
   - **Advanced**: Neo-CLI command line

2. **Upload contract files**:
   - `src/PriceFeed.Contracts/PriceFeed.Oracle.nef`
   - `src/PriceFeed.Contracts/PriceFeed.Oracle.manifest.json`

3. **Initialize contract**:
   ```
   invoke CONTRACT_HASH initialize ["NTmHjwiadq4g3VHpJ5FQigQcD4fF5m8TyX","NiNmXL8FjEUEs1nfX9uHFBNaenxDHJtmuB"]
   invoke CONTRACT_HASH addOracle ["NiNmXL8FjEUEs1nfX9uHFBNaenxDHJtmuB"]
   invoke CONTRACT_HASH setMinOracles [1]
   ```

4. **Update configuration**:
   ```json
   "ContractScriptHash": "0xYOUR_CONTRACT_HASH"
   ```

5. **Run the oracle**:
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project src/PriceFeed.Console --skip-health-checks
   ```

## 💰 **Economic Analysis**

### **Cost Structure**
