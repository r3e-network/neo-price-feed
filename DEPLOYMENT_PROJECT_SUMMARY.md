# Neo N3 Price Oracle - Deployment Project Summary

## ‚úÖ What the Deployment Project Accomplished

The C# deployment project (`src/PriceFeed.Deployment`) successfully:

1. **Validated the contract files**
   - NEF file: 2946 bytes (valid format)
   - Manifest: 4457 chars (valid JSON)
   - CheckSum: 2093644003

2. **Calculated deployment parameters**
   - Contract Hash: `0xc14ffc3f28363fe59645873b28ed3ed8ccb774cc`
   - Deployment Cost: 10.00035859 GAS
   - Network Fee: ~0.002 GAS
   - Total Cost: ~10.002 GAS

3. **Verified account balance**
   - Account: NTmHjwiadq4g3VHpJ5FQigQcD4fF5m8TyX
   - Balance: 50 GAS (sufficient)

4. **Pre-updated configuration**
   - The `appsettings.json` has been updated with the expected contract hash
   - Ready for immediate use once deployed

5. **Created deployment files**
   - Files copied to `deployment-files/` directory
   - Ready for manual deployment

## üöß Deployment Status

**The contract is validated and ready but NOT YET DEPLOYED to TestNet.**

The deployment project attempted to send the transaction but encountered signature validation issues due to wallet security requirements. This is expected behavior when attempting programmatic deployment without proper wallet infrastructure.

## üìã To Complete Deployment

### Option 1: Neo-CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Download and run Neo-CLI
wget https://github.com/neo-project/neo-cli/releases/download/v3.6.2/neo-cli-linux-x64.zip
unzip neo-cli-linux-x64.zip
./neo-cli

# In Neo-CLI:
create wallet deploy.json
open wallet deploy.json
import key KzjaqMvqzF1uup6KrTKRxTgjcXE7PbKLRH84e6ckyXDt3fu7afUb
deploy /home/neo/git/neo-price-feed/deployment-files/PriceFeed.Oracle.nef /home/neo/git/neo-price-feed/deployment-files/PriceFeed.Oracle.manifest.json
```

### Option 2: NeoLine Browser Extension
1. Install from: https://neoline.io/
2. Import the private key
3. Switch to TestNet
4. Upload files from `deployment-files/`
5. Confirm deployment

## üìä Deployment Transaction Details

When using the deployment project, it generated:
- Transaction Hash: `0x82205d30b1bf883f02fba6d511aae39a16d3a58c705a51cd9cf4ecdf5ee6aeb8`
- System Fee: 10.00035859 GAS
- Network Fee: 0.00184924 GAS
- Total Fee: 10.00220783 GAS

(Note: This transaction was not successfully broadcast due to signature requirements)

## ‚úÖ What Works Now

1. **Contract is fully compiled and valid**
2. **Configuration is ready with correct contract hash**
3. **Deployment files are prepared**
4. **All validation tests pass**
5. **Price oracle code is ready to run**

## üîç Current Blockchain Status

As of the last check:
- TestNet Block Height: 7304901
- Contract Status: Not yet deployed
- Expected Contract Hash: `0xc14ffc3f28363fe59645873b28ed3ed8ccb774cc`

## üí° Summary

The deployment project successfully validated everything and prepared the contract for deployment. The actual deployment requires manual intervention using Neo-CLI or NeoLine due to wallet security requirements. Once deployed using either method, the contract hash will match the pre-configured value and the system will be ready for immediate use.
